## Project Idea 
Explore the application of dynamic regional data captured by social media to predict traffic demands to optimize Uber rides.

## Data Table
- File links and short description describing what they are 
- Restricted files (protected information, licensed files, university property, etc) are not linked. 

| Files | Description |
| :---: | :---------: |
| Twitter | Tweets provided by the University of Michigan | 
| SFData | SFMTA vehicle speed data | 
| 

## Resources
- Links to useful resources
| Page | Description | 
|:----:|:-----------:|
| Highest Number of Twitter

## Ideas 
- Choosing time frame of tweet data (window of dates, how much in advance?)
   - Mention an event prior to its occurrence e.g., "Excited for the SF Giants baseball home game on March 17th!" 
     - Indication of location: "SF Giants" + "home" --> SF Giants Stadium
     - Indication of event date: March 17th  
   - Mention a event during the onset of its occurrence. e.g., "Horrible traffic accident on Highway 17" 
     - Indication of location: "Highway 17"
     - Indication of time: time tweet was written 
- Take into account expected traffic times (morning rush hour 7:00 am - 10:00 am)
- Normalize to compare differences rather than exact times?
