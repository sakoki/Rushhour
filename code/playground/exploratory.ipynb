    "## Data\n",
    "The data we are exploring for this project is from the [uber movement](https://movement.uber.com/?lang=en-US) project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some general information about the data:\n",
    "- Data is aggregated into zones to protect personally identifiable information or user behavior.\n",
    "- Data provided stretchs back 3 years ago, from 2016 all the way to 2018. All yearly data is broken up quarterly into separate files.  \n",
    "- Uber provides two zone types: **Census Zones** and **Traffic Analysis Zones**. \n",
    "- **Census Tract** - area roughly equivalent to a neighborhood established by the Bureau of Census for analyzing populations.<sup>1</sup> Generally encompass a population of 1,200 to 8,000 people. <sup>1</sup>\n",
    "- **Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs)** - unit of geography most commonly used in conventional transportation planning models.<sup>2</sup> For typical metropolitan planing software, a zone of under 3000 people is common. Range from very large areas in the exurb to small as city blocks in central buisness districts.<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "- Census zones appear to be larger, while traffic analysis zones provide high resolution details of the regional landscape. \n",
    "- The Traffic Analysis zones data is considerably larger than Census Zones due to finer level details.\n",
    "- Geo Boundaries containing the longitude and latitude ranges for each zone"
