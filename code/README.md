## Explanations of directory structures:
- Files in playground dir are exploratory codes in a format of ipynb(jupyter notebook).
- Files in utils dir contains different kinds of utility functions that can be reused by pipeline code.
- Files in models dir contains models that predict Y given timeseries data(both baseline and improved model) and twitter data (improved model).
- Files directly under code files are pipline files only contains skeleton code needs to call functions in utils and models.


- Choosing time frame of tweet data (window of dates, how much in advance?)
    - Mention an event prior to its occurrence e.g., "Excited for the SF Giants baseball home game on March 17th!"
        - Indication of location: "SF Giants" + "home" --> SF Giants Stadium
        - Indication of event date: March 17th
    -   Mention a event during the onset of its occurrence. e.g., "Horrible traffic accident on Highway 17"
        - Indication of location: "Highway 17"
        - Indication of time: time tweet was written
- Take into account expected traffic times (morning rush hour 7:00 am - 10:00 am)
- Normalize to compare differences rather than exact times?
