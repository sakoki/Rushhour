-   Choosing time frame of tweet data (window of dates, how much in advance?)
    -   Mention an event prior to its occurrence e.g., "Excited for the SF Giants baseball home game on March 17th!"
        -   Indication of location: "SF Giants" + "home" --> SF Giants Stadium
        -   Indication of event date: March 17th
    -   Mention a event during the onset of its occurrence. e.g., "Horrible traffic accident on Highway 17"
        -   Indication of location: "Highway 17"
        -   Indication of time: time tweet was written
-   Take into account expected traffic times (morning rush hour 7:00 am - 10:00 am)
-   Normalize to compare differences rather than exact times?
